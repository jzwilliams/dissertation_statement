# dissertation_statement

A nice formatting template for a LaTeX dissertation. Designed to be nice for printing as a physical book (hence the half-letter-paper statement paper size), but easy to separate the style from the content. It is hopefully fairly painless to extract the actual writing from the formatting and insert it into another style; say, if your institution has particular formatting requirements for dissertations.
