\chapter{Preface}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
How much preface you include probably depends on the requirements of your
institution. Here at Miskatonic senior administration are too busy muttering
words you can never quite catch (certainly not in English, nor in any earthly
language I can think of), so they haven't hassled me much about the chattiness
of my writing.


\section*{Acknowledgements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Every dissertation worth its salt includes acknowledgements. It's sappy, sure.
But if you're honest with yourself you realize you really wouldn't have gotten
to where you are without the help of lots of people! Give them a little credit
here.
