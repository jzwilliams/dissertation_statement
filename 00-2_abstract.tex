\chapter{Abstract}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this part, you've got to summarize all the hard work you've done for readers
too lazy to read the whole book, which is most of them. As painful as it is,
summarize even more. As the saying goes, ``A well-written abstract makes the world go round". Or something.

Oh, and you're on your own when it comes to cover design!
